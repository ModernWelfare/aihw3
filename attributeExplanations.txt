The attributes we used are:
IsHorizontalUnboundedThreeInARowWithOpponent()
	This attribute checks for a connection of 3 tokens in a row horizontally for the current player. Once a connection of 3 is 
	obtained, it then checks both the ends of that connection to see if the ends are open spaces. If they are, it increases the 
	counter of the number of 3 in a row unbounded connections for the player.
	It then carries out the same operation for the opponent.
	It then checks to see if the number of unbounded 3 in a row connections for the current player is greater than or equal to 
	the number of unbounded 3 in a row connections for the opponent. If yes, it returns an affirmative value; else, it returns 
	a negative value.
