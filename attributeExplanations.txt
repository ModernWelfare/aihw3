The attributes we used are:
IsHorizontalUnboundedThreeInARowWithOpponent()
	This attribute checks for a connection of 3 tokens in a row horizontally for the current player. Once a connection of 3 is 
	obtained, it then checks both the ends of that connection to see if the ends are open spaces. If they are, it increases the 
	counter of the number of 3 in a row unbounded horizontal connections for the player.
	It then carries out the same operation for the opponent.
	It then checks to see if the number of unbounded 3 in a row connections for the current player is greater than or equal to 
	the number of unbounded 3 in a row connections for the opponent. If yes, it returns an affirmative value; else, it returns 
	a negative value.

IsVerticalUnboundedThreeInARow()
	This attribute checks for a connection of 3 tokens in a row vertically for the current player. Once a connection of 3 is 
	found, it then checks the top of that connection to see if that is an open space. If it is, it increases the counter of the 
	number of 3 in a row unbounded vertical connections for the player.
	It then carries out the same operation for the opponent.
	It then checks to see if the number of unbounded 3 in a row connections for the current player is greater than or equal to 
	the number of unbounded 3 in a row connections for the opponent. If yes, it returns an affirmative value; else, it returns 
	a negative value.
	
IsHorizontalUnboundedTwoInARowWithOpponent()
	Exactly the same as IsHorizontalUnboundedThreeInARowWithOpponent(), except that it checks for 2 connections instead of 3.
	
IsDiagonalLeftThreeInARow()
	This attribute checks for a connection of 3 tokens in the left diagonal. Once a connection of 3 is found, it increments the 
	counter for the number of 3 connections in a left diagonal row. Depending on the connections found, it returns either an 
	affirmative or negative value.
	
IsPlayerOneMoveFirst()
	This attribute checks to see if the current player was the player that made the first move in the game. If yes, it returns 
	an affirmative value; else, it returns a negative value.
