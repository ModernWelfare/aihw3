How to run the file:

1. unzip the submission package, put the test_dataset folder and bli_tnarayan_project3.jar under the same directory

2. in the windows commandline, run "java -jar bli_tnarayan_project3.jar" 

3. open the C:/AIproj3 folder to view the generated csv file bli_tnarayan_project3.csv

the test_dataset folder is crucial for the program to run correctly because we need to use the training data to generate a decision tree.
